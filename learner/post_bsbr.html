                <h3>TESDA ENCOURAGES SCHOLARS TO REGISTER TO BSRS</h3>
                <p>May 13, 2022
                    <br><br>

                    Taguig City – The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) is encouraging existing and aspiring scholars to use its newly-launched Biometric-Enabled Scholarship Registration System (BSRS).

                    TESDA Secretary Isidro Lapeña again emphasized that through the BSRS, registration of scholars and attendance checking will be more convenient and will ensure the integrity of the agency’s scholarship programs.
                    
                    “One way to institute integrity in our systems and processes is by way of automation. Not only does automation improve an organization’s efficiency, but also prevents errors and manipulation caused by human intervention,” Lapeña said.
                    
                    With the implementation of BSRS, fraudulent claims such as unregistered programs, shortened training, ghost trainees, ghost training, and unauthorized trainees are being prevented.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Further, through BSRS, trainers and technical vocational education and training (TVET) providers can monitor and view the progress of scholars such as their class schedules, and view the attendance sheet.
                    
                    Likewise, BSRS ensures the integrity of data and minimizes the central encoding as the students/scholars themselves are the ones who put their information and not the field offices or the registrars.
                    
                    “When our system is compromised, the integrity of our implementation is certainly affected. Our major frontline service relies heavily on training delivery. As such, we have to institute reforms to safeguard our system,” the TESDA Chief said.
                    
                    As of May 10, a total of 58,466 BSRS accounts for scholars were created while 28,129 and 3,025 accounts for trainers and registrars respectively.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    To further promote the use of BSRS among TESDA Technology Institutions (TTIs) and Technical Vocational Institutions (TVIs) in the regions, TESDA’s Information and Communication Technology Office (ICTO) is set to hold regional fora to be attended by TVET providers.

                    “We need to implement this and I know this is doable. The BSRS will save time and effort of our TTIs, TVIs, and our would-be and existing scholars in our scholarship programs.” Lapeña said.
                    
                    It can be recalled that TESDA announced the nationwide roll out of the BSRS last April 11 after the pilot testing done early this year.
                    
                    To register, just visit bsrs.tesda.gov.ph using any smart devices connected to the internet.
