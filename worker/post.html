                <h3>2 MORE TESDA-DAIKIN HVAC TRAINING CENTERS TO OPEN IN CEBU, DAVAO CITY</h3>
                <p>May 23, 2022
                    <br><br>

                    Taguig City – The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) is set to open two more training centers dedicated for Heating, Ventilation, and Air conditioning (HVAC) sector through its continued partnership with a Japanese air conditioning company.
                    
                    TESDA Secretary Isidro Lapeña and Daikin Philippines President Takayoshi Miki led the launching of two TESDA-Daikin HVAC Training Centers in Cebu City and Davao City last May 18 and 19, respectively.
                    
                    The HVAC Training Centers in Cebu City and Davao City is part of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between TESDA and Daikin Philippines which was signed last July 15, 2021.
                    
                    It can be recalled that the first HVAC Training Center was opened inside the TESDA Complex in Taguig City last December 2021.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    In Region VII, the Regional Training Center (RTC) - Cebu will provide a facility that Daikin will renovate into a state- of-the-art HVAC Training Center by devising and executing higher-level training programs to generate employees trained in the latest technology in air-conditioning installation and maintenance.
                    
                    Meanwhile, in Region XI, Daikin is currently refurbishing the region’s existing HVAC Training Center located at RTC-KorPhil in Davao City to be at par with the international standards.
                    
                    Lapeña expressed hope that TESDA and Daikin will soon produce more highly-equipped Filipinos in the HVAC sector as their partnership have reached Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    The TESDA Chief also thanked Daikin Philippines President Miki and Training and Product Manager Justin Aaron Sy for the expansion of the TESDA-Daikin partnership to provide industry-driven training programs particularly in the HVAC sector.
                    
                    “The goal of this partnership is to advocate and elevate the Philippine airconditioning industry to greater heights. This, in turn, will increase the available opportunities for our kababayans,” Lapeña said.
                    
                    After the renovation, the public can expect a modernized venue for training, not just for new learners, but also for professionals who want to upgrade their existing skills.
                    
                    Also present in both events were Deputy Director General for TESD Operations Lina Sarmiento and Chief-of-Staff Director Juliet Orozco. TESDA Regional Directors Gamaliel Vicente, Jr. and Lorenzo Macapili also graced the Cebu and Davao events, respectively.
